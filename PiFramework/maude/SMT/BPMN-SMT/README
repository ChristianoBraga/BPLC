---- Formal Modelling and Analysis of BPMN using Maude
---- authors: Francisco Duran, Gwen Salaun, and Camilo Rocha
---- file: README

Files:
- bpmn.maude
  Contains the Maude specification of BPMN. It is the main file containing
  most of the specification, including all rules.
- my-real-time-maude.maude
  Contains some of the modules in the official distribution of Real-Time Maude.
  We only use the definition of Time and TimeInf sorts and operations on them.
- run.maude
  This file in the main file for the execution of data-aware BPMN processes.
- apmaude.maude
  This file contains operations for the automated analysis of BPMN processes.
  Includes definitions for workloads, tick rules, analysis, etc.
- examples
  This directory includes some examples showing different BPMN processes to
  be directly used on our Maude specification of BPMN.

How to execute the examples:

The run.maude file loads all other necessary files, so any example can be
executed just by loading it into Maude, or by running the Maude executable
with it as an argument. If you move into the provided MaudeBPMN folder, and
assuming maude is in your path, just write:

> maude run.maude

You may run a different example just by changing the file loaded in the
run.maude file, that is, just replace the line

load <path-to-your-file>/<name-of-file-with-example>.maude

as you will.
