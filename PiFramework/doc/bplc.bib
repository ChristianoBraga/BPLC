An experiment performed on world's fastest conditional rewriting engines shows that speedups for conditional rewriting of an order of magnitude can already be obtained by applying the presented technique as a front-end transformation.},

This hinders reuse of parts of the semantics of one language when specifying a different language -- even when the two languages have many constructs in common -- and evolution of a language may require major reformulation of its semantics.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a modular rewriting semantics (MRS) specification for Reppy's Concurrent ML (CML), based on Peter Mosses' modular structural operational semantics specification for CML. A modular rewriting semantics specification for a programming language is a rewrite theory in rewriting logic written using techniques that support the modular development of the specification in the precise sense that every module extension is conservative. We show that the MRS of CML can be used to interpret CML programs using the rewrite engine of the Maude system, a high-performance implementation of rewriting logic, and to verify CML programs using Maude's built-in LTL model checker. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic concepts of structural operational semantics and algebraic specifications.},
