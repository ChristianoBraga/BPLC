&pi;-lib is a library of basic programming languages constructs whose semantics are formally specified in &pi;-automata. Therefore, to give semantics to a programming language means to relate constructions of the given language with the constructs of &pi;-lib. It is implemented in the [Maude](http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu) language, by Christiano Braga (<http://www.ic.uff.br/~cbraga>).

## System requirements

* This version of &pi;-lib runs on version 2.7.1 of the [Maude](http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu) system. 
* [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com) on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/br/macos/) produces a nicer experience.

## Acknowledgements

&pi;-lib is a result of a collaboration with [Fabrício Chalub](http://fcbr.github.io), [José Meseguer](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/m/Meseguer:Jos=eacute=) and [Peter D. Mosses](http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~cspdm/). The signature of BPLC has the same roots as the [Component Based Semantics](https://plancomps.csle.cs.rhul.ac.uk/taosd2015/) in the [Programming Language Components and Specifications project](https://plancomps.csle.cs.rhul.ac.uk/). The semantic framework that BPLC implements is Generalized Interpreting Automata.
