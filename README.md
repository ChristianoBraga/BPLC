# BPLC
Basic Programming Languages Constructs is a library of common programming language constructs whose semantics are formally specified. Therefore, to give semantics to a programming language means to relate constructions of the given language with the constructs of BPLC. It is implemented in the [Maude](http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu) language, by Christiano Braga (<http://www.ic.uff.br/~cbraga>).

## System requirements

* This version of BPLC implementation runs on the Logical Model Checker extension of Maude available at http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/tools/lmc/
